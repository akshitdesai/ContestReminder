## Motivation
As a competitive programmer, I always want to participate in every contest I can. But sometimes I forgot and misses the contests.
Some of the platforms send reminders as CF sends reminds before 1 day, HE sends reminders via message.

So I decided to make an app that sends reminder mail(mail with clean design and contest link) uniformly just before an hour or half an hour And also I can change my preferences in between.

## Future Scope

* Instead of mail, we can give an option either mail or SMS.
* We can send reminders for the hackathons too. (From Devfolio, Devpost)
* We can start a newsletter and mail a newsletter about new technologies and trends.
* We can merge [Image-genrator](https://github.com/codestromer/contest-image-generator) to this project.(Useful to college coding clubs)
